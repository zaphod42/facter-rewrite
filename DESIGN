Scan directories for executable files. Execute each file with no options. Each
file prints to stdout either a fact book or an index

Fact book:

  application/facter-book+json
  {
    "fact name": { "some": ["value"] },
    "second fact": 2
  }

Index:

  application/facter-index+json
  {
    depends: ["different fact"]
    provides: ["fact name", "another fact"]
  }

If the program printed an index then it can be executed again with options of
the values of the facts that book depends on.
